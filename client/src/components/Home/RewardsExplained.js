At that point the goal's value will appear in red. If you think that for some reason the goal is not ready to be validated (not fulfilling the S.M.A.R.T goal requirement, value too high or too low...), you can say so in a message and send it back for the student to review.

It is up to you to agree with them and pay half of the goal's value (the other half is given by the other adult), or send a message to the student explaining why you don't think they have achieved their goal yet.
