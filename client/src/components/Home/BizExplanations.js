                <h2>What is XXX?</h2>
                    <p>XXX is a goal setting app where children/students ARE THE ONES SETTING THEIR OWN GOALS. Most "rewards" apps put the reponsability of goal setting in the adult's hands. But who better than the children can decide what they need and want to achieve? </p>
                    <p>With guidance and adult supervision, students create their own goals that get validated and monitored by both <u>parents</u> and <u>educators</u>. </p>
                    <p>Once they achieve their goals, they get "paid" by parents and educators (only if they agree that the goal has been reached).</p>
                    <p>The students earn stars in their wallets that they can later spend in the marketplace.</p>

                        <p>On XXX, as a business owner in our community, you can post items to the marketplace.</p>
                        <p> Not only will you help the students, motivating them to create and achieve goals, but through posting an item, you will also promote your business.</p>

                        A student can earn from 1 to 5 stars per goal achieved : we suggest setting a fair price for the item you are posting, that encourages the student to work hard towards getting it, while not feeling like it is an impossible task.
